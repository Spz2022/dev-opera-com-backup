    <p>A 2&#8211;year reign of terror ended on the 13th of April, when Cardiff man Elwyn Jones was put behind bars for carrying out a string of hate crimes on dairy cows at a local farm. The farmhand took exception to the fact that the farmer passed away in 2007, leaving the farm and all its contents to his beloved cows &#8212; meaning that the cows were now Jones&#8217; employers and landlords. His crimes included spitting in the cow&#8217;s food, and anti-bovine graffiti.</p>
