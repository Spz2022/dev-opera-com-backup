<content>Media Capture is one of the most interesting features in web applications, especially for mobile devices. Surprisingly capturing media on the spot is quite a new thing for browsers in general, until recently always being delegated to browser plugins such as Flash or Silverlight. In this article we will explore how to use the Media Capture APIs, their compatibility across mobile browsers and the current state of the W3C specifications that define them.</content>

<content>Now that Opera for Android is out, you&#39;ll sometimes need to debug it, as there are differences in Standards support between Opera and Chrome for Android and Chrome on Android 4+. Because current and future Opera for Android releases are based on Chromium, we can&#39;t use the current Opera desktop releases to connect to them (wait for Chromium-based Opera desktop releases for that). So here&#39;s how to connect Opera for Android to another Chromium-based desktop browser for remote debugging.</content>

<content>Opera Mini is one of the world&#39;s foremost mobile browsers, which runs on pretty much any device, even low-powered ones. It is a proxy-based browser, which has many advantages, including reducing the size of pages downloaded onto the user&#39;s phone by up to 90%. On the downside, JavaScript can behave in unexpected ways when requested by Opera Mini. In this article we&#39;ll discuss exactly what this means for your development work, in detail.</content>
