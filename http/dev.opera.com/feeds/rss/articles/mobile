<description>Now that Opera for Android is out, you&#39;ll sometimes need to debug it, as there are differences in Standards support between Opera and Chrome for Android and Chrome on Android 4+. Because current and future Opera for Android releases are based on Chromium, we can&#39;t use the current Opera desktop releases to connect to them (wait for Chromium-based Opera desktop releases for that).
