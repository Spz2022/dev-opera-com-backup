<description>The Network Service Discovery API enables web pages to communicate with devices advertising themselves on the network via different discovery protocols in a peer-to-peer configuration. Now you can use JavaScript to find a UPnP server locally, browse its content and send that content to a UPnP client. This article, with links to experimental builds, shows you how.</description>

<description>Opera Mobile brings the Web to millions of people through their mobile phones and other non-desktop devices. Opera believes in giving people access to the full Web, and not making the distinction of a “mobile web”. To help automated mobile testing, we&#39;ve updated the Opera Mobile Emulator so it can talk to our browser automation library, OperaDriver. </description>

<title>Opera Mobile Emulator build with experimental WebKit prefix support</title>
<link>http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/opera-mobile-emulator-experimental-webkit-prefix-support</link>

<description>Through our site compatibility work, we have experienced that many site authors only use -webkit- prefixed CSS, thereby ignoring other vendor prefixes and not even including an unprefixed equivalent. This leads to a reduced user experience on non-WebKit browsers, as they don&#39;t receive the same shiny effects, even although they support them. To tackle this problem, we are releasing an experimental Opera Mobile Emulator build with experimental support for selected -webkit- prefixes.</description>
