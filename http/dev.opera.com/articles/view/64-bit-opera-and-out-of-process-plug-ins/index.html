      <h1>64-bit Opera, and out-of-process plug-ins</h1>
      <p class="print author">By Chris Mills</p>

      <p class="note"><strong>Update, November 22nd 2012</strong>: Please note that Opera 12.00 final shipped with 64-bit and OOPP support, and that as of version 12.02, OOPP is disabled for Windows 32-bit.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Update, February 9th 2012</strong>: Article originally published just before Christmas 2011, and now updated with a new set of builds.</p>

<p>Thanks for all your great feedback so far. We&#39;ve updated the <a href="index.html#builds">out-of-process plug-ins (OOPP) builds</a> to a newer version containing many fixes and updates. A lot of work has been done in the plugin backends on our various platforms. Keep testing with all the plugins you usually use, and remember to report back any issues to us!</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>As the snow settles on the ground, and the elves draw close to finishing construction of all their toy orders, it may not surprise you to learn that Opera&#39;s little helpers have also been very busy, adding exciting new innovations to our desktop browser!</p> 

 <p>As a last release before Christmas, we are bringing you a new labs release featuring two exquisitely wrapped presents:</p> 

 <ul> 
   <li>64-bit builds</li> 
   <li>Out-of-process plug-ins</li> 
 </ul> 

 <p>Let&#39;s look at these features in more detail.</p> 

 <h2>Out-of-process plug-ins</h2> 

 <p>We monitor our built-in crash logger carefully to see what is still causing browser crashes, post release. One very common source of instability is one that we unfortunately can&#39;t fix ourselves: browser plug-ins. We fixed this problem for Opera on Linux and FreeBSD a long time ago by running plug-ins in a separate process. This allows us to control exactly what communication takes place between Opera and running plug-ins, improving security and stability in the process. If a plug-in accidentally crashes under this system, Opera will keep on running, and a simple page reload will correct the plug-in.</p> 

 <p>This architecture is now coming to a Windows or Mac machine near you! This labs release provides an early preview of the new rewritten version for Mac/Win/Linux/FreeBSD, constructed to allow our code to work across all platforms.</p> 

 <h2>64-bit builds</h2> 

 <p>Bringing the out-of-process plug-in architecture across to Windows and Mac also brings another advantage: the ability to run plug-ins compiled for Intel 32-bit architecture from within a 64-bit Opera process. And 64-bit Opera is the other delightful gift we&#39;re giving you at Opera Labs this Christmas!</p> 

 <p>64-bit Windows and Mac have been in the works for a while, but we didn&#39;t want to release them until we had a way of running all plug-ins that&#39;s completely transparent to the user: This is now possible with the out-of-process plug-in architecture, so here we are! The 64-bit versions of Opera offer performance improvements in some specific areas and allow Opera to have more freedom in allocating memory.</p>

 <h2>Release notes and known issues</h2> 

<p>Original issues removed as they are no longer relevant.</p>

 <p class="note">Note on bug reporting: This build is based on Opera 12 (Wahoo) therefore it includes all the features from recent Opera Next snapshots, including hardware acceleration. When reporting plug-in bugs in this build, it&#39;s always interesting to know if hardware acceleration is on or off, and if toggling it makes a difference. You can turn off hardware acceleration by setting <a href="opera:config#UserPrefs|EnableHardwareAcceleration">opera:config#UserPrefs|EnableHardwareAcceleration</a> to 0 and restarting the browser.</p>

      <section class="commentcontent"><span class="bubble-arrow"></span>These are good news, because the plugins (with Adobe Flash Player in the first place) are causing about 99% of all Opera crashes. On my PC at work it&#39;s so unstable, that Flash Player (especially on YouTube) is causing the blue screens... o_O But it happens only in Opera, so I will look into this new labs release for sure. Thanks! :)</section>

      <section class="commentcontent"><span class="bubble-arrow"></span>Win 7/64-bit version looks good, but had a couple of initial problems.  Wand.dat copied from Opera Next wasn&#39;t recognized until I switched off Hardware Acceleration.  Now coming back to HA, it&#39;s recognized.  <br/><br/>Also, there&#39;s a site on my Speed Dial, real-debrid.com, that kept throwing up the same certificate box, something with &quot;static&quot; in it but I can&#39;t find the screenshot I thought I saved.  The box would appear, then disappear after a couple of seconds if I didn&#39;t click on something.  If I was fast enough, I&#39;d get to the Approve box on the second tab and click that, but the box would keep coming back up.  I&#39;d open another Speed Dial screen just to check and it would start all over again.  Finally, I decided to just click the Approve tab and that seemed to cool it down a lot, tho not completely.  It wasn&#39;t until I turned off HA that it stopped (or perhaps that was coincidental?).  Coming back to HA, there&#39;s no longer a problem with that site on the Speed Dial.<br/><br/>P.S.  After saving this post, the screen did not refocus on my message, but went to about halfway down the page.  After typing the previous sentence, it focused on the top of the page.</section>

Anyway around that?  This appears to be a very stable build and worthy of using/testing as a primary browser.  </section>

Rubert <br/>i think you miss point the purpose of 64 bit. the future will be a 64 bit. this only to make opera a future proof. a sort like that. the other function on opera. it is not get good promote. if it promote like chrome browser e.g demo or something useful to tryout. it maybe get the attention. it is not get enough example or demo the opera can do but the others can not do right now. till when the opera user hope the tryout the other browser  demo will compatible with this awesome browser. Do you Dev team make special page to introduce the awesome features available on opera to show out. i&#39;m so envy that the other browser like Firefox, Chrome and IE have this page.<br/>that just my 5 cent...</section>

      <section class="commentcontent"><span class="bubble-arrow"></span>Ricardo: Different teams have different projects. 64-bit work has several benefits: Opera will not need Windows 32-bit compatibility support. Performance may be a little faster. Better memory model and MORE memory access, good for lots of tabs and GREAT for future 3D game support. This also sets a foundation for Windows 8, and for more Core improvements in Opera. Some of your feature suggestions are interesting, and many people have asked for them already. But mostly they are the responsibility of a different team, and will appear (or not) in accordance with relevant efforts.<br/><br/>This 64-bit Labs build seems overall quite nice. I have provided feedback already at <a href="http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/2011/12/15/64-bit-and-out-of-process-plugins-builds-now-available-on-labs?cid=77410902&amp;startidx=50#comment77410902" target="_blank">http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/2011/12/15/64-bit-and-out-of-process-plugins-builds-now-available-on-labs?cid=77410902&amp;startidx=50#comment77410902</a> . I will have to attach an email account, set up Link, run some heavy stress tests that will load the memory access.<br/><br/>Something that interests me: Opera.exe seems to use only one CPU core even now, however OperaPluginWrapper.exe can use another (single) core. This is acceptable, and improves plugin performance when in Power Saver mode on my laptop. However it would be nice for everyone if Web Workers could also be deferred to another process, as discussed when Workers were first introduced.</section>

      <section class="commentcontent"><span class="bubble-arrow"></span>@Michael Smith. Sorry for the confusion - I appreciate that it can be confusing having so many different types of browser building hanging around. The difference is this:<br/><br/>1. The Opera builds you download from opera.com/browser are our final, complete, stable, finished builds. Currently, this is 11.60.<br/><br/>2. The Opera Next builds you download from opera.com/browser/next are alpha or beta preview versions of the next version of the browser, after the finished stable one described above. These are mostly ok, but might have a few wrinkles to iron out. Currently, we are on Opera 12.00 alpha for the Opera Next version. <br/><br/>3. The Opera builds you will find here, at Opera labs, are pre-alpha, experimental versions to show case experimental new features that definitely aren&#39;t finished yet. These WILL have significant bugs present, and probably shouldn&#39;t be used as your primary browser, although we do make sure they won&#39;t eat your hard drive before release ;-)<br/><br/>Hope this helps - feel free to ask if you have any more questions. Designers are most welcome here, just as much as developers.  <br/><br/>Chris Mills<br/>dev.opera.com editor</section>

      <section class="commentcontent"><span class="bubble-arrow"></span>Unfortunately, this version crashes on YouTube too... :( Luckily for me it didn&#39;t cause the blue screen this time.

I didn&#39;t do anything, but after a few minutes I got the blue screen.<br/>12.00 build 1211 (32bit) - stopped working on the first attempt to watch a random video on YouTube. The browser crashed. But I didn&#39;t get the blue screen when I closed the Opera.exe process using task manager. On Google Chrome YT works (but I can&#39;t resize the player, and Chrome becomes extremely slow on YouTube), on Firefoks it works well, but this browser is very slow. But Chrome and Firefox are my only options for youtube... :(<br/><br/>EDIT: I reported this before and it seems that someone was trying to fix that, but this bug is still in Opera.

      <section class="commentcontent"><span class="bubble-arrow"></span>I have noticed also.. that opera collects the cache ( if i browse from one website to the next, storing it for easy page loading when i press back ) and starts slowing down.. can you guys implement a new cache system for that.. say only remember 3 last pages out of the 20 so it doesn&#39;t conserve as much ram? i know it clears after i close it, but just saying... it slows down after a while and i have to restart the browser.. which is soo boring to do.</section>

      <p class="commentdate">Sunday, January 1, 2012</p>
      <section class="commentcontent"><span class="bubble-arrow"></span>I like the idea of &quot;Out of Process Plugins&quot; (I attempted to pitch a similar idea to Opera Software many years ago in a forum topic that appears to be gone now as a way to run 32-bit plugins in a 64-bit browser, but was ignored at the time). I may have to see if I can still log in to Operawatch to post about this, or if Daniel has closed it down for good, as I consider both &quot;Out of Process Plugins&quot; and 64-bit builds to be very much worth blogging about.<br/><br/>Also, I have been having some thoughts lately about something else that should be &quot;Out of Process&quot;, and the idea is enhanced security. I figured I might as well post it here, since I don&#39;t really visit any of the development or labs blogs anymore.<br/><br/>The idea is quite simply that the layout engine should run as a separate process, and should always be executed with limited rights (even when the browser&#39;s UI is launched with admin rights). Theoretically this would add a layer of security, and may limit the number of possible security vulnerabilities. Especially if the plugin wrapper could also run with limited user rights (I&#39;m not sure if every plugin would work right when run as a limited user, but I would hope that there would be less security issues that way).<br/><br/>Obviously I haven&#39;t sat down and thought out every detail about how it would work, but I assume something like this would be possible:<ul class="bullets"><li> UI passes URL that user typed in address bar to the layout engine, and layout engine (running as a limited user) loads page, renders it, and sends result back to the UI to display for the user.</li><li> User interaction is sent to the layout engine by the UI, and all responses to user interaction are processed by the layout engine (once again running as a limited user).</li><li> The process that renders the UI can be running with admin rights, but the layout engine&#39;s process will always run with limited rights to minimize security risks.</li><li> All extensions are processed by the layout engine (running with limited rights), and results are sent back to the UI for it to display to the user.</li><li> Downloaded files to be saved are sent to the UI so that they can be saved with the same rights that the user launched the browser with.</li></ul><br/><br/>Obviously this would not prevent a lot of security vulnerabilities, however my thoughts are that this would help prevent some security vulnerabilities, and perhaps cut down on some of the risks of browsing on operating system where your web browser is running with admin rights. ;)</section>

      <section class="commentcontent"><span class="bubble-arrow"></span>is that something like Opera will be 64-bit rather than the standard 32 bit one? Opera is currently in 32 bit, i guess it will be better if Opera will also have 64 bit version for 64 bit machines....<br/><br/>and by the way, please update Opera Gestures.... i am using it actually, opening new tabs, opening links in background tab, etc.... please re-arrange them because gestures location seems so confusing like closing tab was place under open gesture, (open - close?) and please include cycling / switching tabs.... thanks!!! :) keep on improving Opera!!! :)<br/><br/>facebook videocall, when will you come for Opera? Opera is the only browser i know and only Opera has no facebook videocall plug in support.... :(<br/><br/>hahah.... Cheers!</section>

      <section class="commentcontent"><span class="bubble-arrow"></span>Excellent! Dedicating plugins to a seperate process is a good idea. I&#39;d want to see each tab having its own process as well, since the Opera main program is using more CPU and memory than the plugin wrapper (according to Windows Task Manager).<br/><br/>Question: When I first run Opera OOPL and launched a Flash game, the 64-bit plugin wrapper is used. When I copied my user profile from Opera 10.63 (and thus using the saved tabs from my O10.63 session), I see that the 32-bit wrapper is used instead (I don&#39;t know why, maybe I have a 32-bit-only plugin like QuickTime used without knowing it). Is there any way to give the 64-bit wrapper a higher precedence? In other words, when Opera sees both 64-bit and 32-bit versions of the same plugin, it would use the 64-bit one?<br/><br/><b>MODIFY</b> - Nevermind, I found the solution: <a href="http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/2011/12/15/64-bit-and-out-of-process-plugins-builds-now-available-on-labs?cid=85989322&amp;startidx=150#comment85989322" target="_blank">http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/2011/12/15/64-bit-and-out-of-process-plugins-builds-now-available-on-labs?cid=85989322&amp;startidx=150#comment85989322</a></section>

      <section class="commentcontent"><span class="bubble-arrow"></span>I am experiencing some odd issues with Opera 12.00 x64 on Windows XP x64 Pro SP2. The interesting thing is that I was experiencing some of them with Opera 11.60 under Windows XP x86 Pro SP3.<br/><br/>Everything is fine after installation but some days later I start to notice strange things.<br/>1) Opera pauses loading the page from some server at some moment and it pauses at the same place every time I hit F5. Few minutes later the problem dosappears. I have awful connection to the internet but at the time Opera struggles the Internet Explorer and Firefox have no problems. This was noticed in opera 11.60 x86 also.<br/>2) Some times I can&#39;t refresh the page, every time I press F5 the old version appears. I have the similar problem with ReCaptcha, the ReCaptha frame, it showes the old code until I press the refresh button one or two times. This was noticed in opera 11.60 x86 also.<br/>3) Opera 12.00 x64 can crash unexpectively at the moment of opening the link in new tab, there were some crash reports submitted by the built-in system but no info was given on them by your system.<br/>4) Sometimes there&#39;s the strange lag in the tab bar, it shows the white shifted gosts of the tab icon frames and the gosts remain still when I close or open tabs. This artefact does not dissappear until I close the windows, containing it. This was also noticed in Opera 11.60 x86.<br/><br/>Mentione bugs became a bit less frquent with 12.00 x64 but they remain. I have like 5 windows opened all time and like 10-30 tabs in each window.<br/><br/>PC config is: Core2Duo overclocked by 65%, 4GB of RAM, Gigabyte 965P-DS4, Radeon HD4850 1GB. The VGA, memory and CPU survived the death of old mobo but they are working perfectly with all other software I have including hardware accelerated and 3D games. memtest86+  and  LinX were also used and showed no faults.<br/><br/>All these bugs appear inpedendently from the pugins installed or enabled. I have uploaded the copy of my current config file, the most settings very the same in Opera 11.60.<br/><a href="http://rghost.net/37386079" target="_blank">http://rghost.net/37386079</a><br/><br/>I have also sent you some screenshots through private messages.</section>
