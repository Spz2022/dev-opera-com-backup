<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>There are many Opera browsers, but each uses the same rendering
engine, which is called Opera Presto. You can be sure that every device,
desktop or mobile running a browser with Opera Presto 2.1 will render the
Web site identically, although with a browser user interface appropriate
to that device.</p> 

<p>Opera Presto 2.1 has very thorough support for current
standards like (X)HTML, XML, XSLT, CSS 2.1, SVG 1.1, JavaScript and the DOM, but
it also includes support for many aspects of nascent standards such as
HTML 5 and CSS 3. Opera passes the Acid 1 and 2 tests, and scores 83% on
the Acid 3 test—<a href="http://www.acidtests.org/">check the Acid tests
out for yourself</a>.</p>

<p class="comment">Thanks a lot to everyone who wrote the examples
featured below.</p>

<h2 id="standardssupport">Opera Presto 2.1 Web standards support</h2>

<h3 id="commonstandards">(X)HTML, CSS 2.1 and JavaScript</h3>

<p>As we all know, (X)HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the three mainstays
that we do most of our Web site building in; it also won&#8217;t be a surprise
to many of you that Opera has a reputation for being one of the most
standards-compliant browsers. This reputation starts with current Web
standards, and is gradually building forwards to some of the more
emergent ones, which we&#8217;ll discuss later.</p> 

<p>Presto 2.1 supports</p>
<ul> 
	<li><a href="http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/#html">the majority of
the HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.1 specifications</a>;</li> <li><a href="http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/#css">the full CSS 2.1 specification, with the exception of <code>visibility: collapse;</code></a>;</li>

    <li>much of <a href="http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/#ecmascript">ECMAScript/
    JavaScript</a>. </li> 
    <li>all <a href="http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/opera95/#dom">DOM 2 interfaces</a> with minor exceptions, and a number of DOM 3 interfaces.</li> 
</ul> 
    
<h3 id="css3">CSS 3</h3>

<p>CSS3 is currently still an emerging technology, with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work#CSS3" title="CSS 3current work">different parts of its specification at various different
stages</a>. Opera Presto 2.1  supports many of the more complete parts of the
spec, including the majority of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-beijing/">CSS Snapshot 2007</a>, as explored below.</p>

<h4>Media queries</h4>

<p>Media queries are a CSS 3 construct, which work like Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="../supporting-ie-with-conditional-comments/index.html">conditional comments</a>, except that these are web standards
rather than proprietary constructs, and you can ask more advanced queries
of the renderer than simply &#8220;what version are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>For example, you can enclose a block of CSS
rules inside a media query, and then have them applied to your markup
(or not) depending on a condition, such as &#8220;is the browser window less than
480 pixels wide&#8221;? Put into code, this would look something like so:</p> 

<pre>
img { 
    margin: 0 0 10px 10px; 
    float: right;
}

@media all and (max-width: 480px) { 
    img { 
        margin: 10px auto;
        float: none; 
        display: block;
        font-size: 80%;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>I&#8217;m sure you can immediately see the benefits here—this kind of
dynamic layout optimization is very powerful for cutting down on dynamic
code, and making sites behave better on alternative devices, such as
mobile phones (although to target rules at mobile browsers such as Opera
Mini and Opera Mobile, you need to use <code>max-device-width</code>
instead, as <code>max-width</code> uses the width of the virtual
viewport).</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a more complicated example containing two media queries—one
changes the floats to block display when the width gets down to 480
pixels, and the other removes the image altogether when it gets down to
240 pixels:</p>

<pre>body { 
    max-width: 800px; 
    font-family: georgia, serif;
}

img { 
    margin: 0 0 10px 10px; 
    float: right;
}

.info { 
    position: absolute; 
    left: 8000px;
}

@media all and (max-width: 480px) { 
    img { 
        margin: 10px auto;
        float: none; 
        display: block;
    }
}

@media all and (max-width: 240px) { 
    img { display: none; }
    .info { position: static; }
}</pre>

<p>See this <a href="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/418/article.html">example of  a media
query in action </a>&#x2014;watch what happens to the images as you resize your browser window. David Storey has <a href="http://files.myopera.com/dstorey/experiments/dynamicmediaqueries.html">another media query example
</a> that adjusts the width of image for the browser window.</p>

<h4>Text shadows</h4>

<p>Applying drop shadows to text used to mean serving the text as an image and messing about with the positioning, but that&#8217;s no longer the case:
the creators of CSS3 have introduced a nice easy property to do it all
for you called <code>text-shadow</code>. As you will see below, this
makes shadows easy to control. The CSS for the example I&#8217;ll display in
this section looks like so:</p>

<pre>body { 
    max-width: 800px; 
    font-family: georgia, serif;
}

h1 { text-shadow: #555 3px 3px 4px; }

h2 { text-shadow: #f00 0px -5px 10px; }

a { 
    font-size: 120%; 
    text-shadow: #555 2px 2px 0px; 
    border: 1px solid black;
}

p.shadow { 
    color: #ccc; 
    text-decoration: bold; 
    text-shadow: #000 2px 2px 2px;
}</pre>

<p>In the <code>text-shadow</code> property, the values from left to
right set the colour of the shadow, the left/right and top/bottom
offsets of the shadow (negative values move the shadow left/up, and
positive values move the shadow right/down), and the amount of blurring
for the shadow. Check out the <a href="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/418/dropShadow.html">drop shadow example</a> to see what effects the CSS has. The HTML doesn’t contain anything special—just a level 1 and
level 2 heading, some text, a preformatted code section, and a link.</p>

<p>In Opera Presto 2.1  you can also make use of multiple text shadows, like
so:</p>

<pre>text-shadow: 0 0 4px white, 0 -5px 4px #ff3, 2px -10px 6px #fd3, -2px -15px 11px #f80, 2px -25px 18px #f20;</pre>

<p>You just chain the different shadows together inside a single CSS
property, delimiting them using commas.</p>

<p style="background:#000; font-size: 200%; padding:5px; text-shadow: 00 4px white, 0 -5px 4px #ff3, 2px -10px 6px #fd3, -2px -15px 11px #f80,2px -25px 18px #f20;">This text has the shadow applied! Cool huh?</p>

<p>If you want to know more, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-css3-text-20030514/#text-shadows" title="The CSS 3 spec text shadow section">visit the CSS3 spec</a>.</p>

<h4>Background sizing</h4>

<p>There are many different screen resolutions in the world, and it can
be hard to create graphics so that they work nicely across all those
different resolutions—your lovely designs can be broken if you’re not
careful, and don’t give this fact enough forethought. There are ways to
bullet-proof things like rounded corner boxes and background repeated
images, but they are sometimes tricky.</p>

<p>Check out this <a href="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/418/background-sizing1.html">single column example</a>. This is a simple
single column—a heading and a paragraph inside a <code>div</code>, with
a background graphic repeated vertically. The CSS looks like this:</p>

<pre>div {
  background-image: url(bkgd_col.png);
  background-repeat: repeat-y;
  border: 1px solid #466900;
}

h1 {
font: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif;
margin: 0;
background: url(transparency.png);
 padding: 0 50px;
 font-style: italic;
 color: #F1921A;

}

p {
  font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  padding: 0 50px;
}

p+p {
  margin-top: 1em;
}</pre>

<p>the trouble is that the text breaks out of the column after the
viewport gets any wider than about 400 pixels. You could fix this by
setting the <code>max-width</code> value to 400 pixels, but wouldn’t it
be nice if the image just scaled with the paragraph width increase? CSS
provides a way to do this—background size. If you add a
<code>-o-background-size</code> declaration to the <code>div</code>
rule, you’ll end up with this <a href="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/418/background-sizing2.html">background sizing example</a>.</p>


<p>We&#39;ve added the rule <code>-o-background-size: 100%
auto;</code> . The first value is the x value, and the second is the y value. This example says &quot;always make the image
expand to 100% of the container width&quot;. If there is only one value specified, it is applied to both the
width and height. The <code>background-size</code> property accepts
percentage and length values as well as <code>auto</code>, which preserves the aspect
ratio.</p>
<p class="note">Opera uses an
experimental version of this, hence the <code>-o-</code> prefix. Webkit
and KHTML also have experimental implementations (using their
<code>-webkit-</code> and <code>-khtml-</code> prefixes) so to ensure
maximum compatibility for now, add multiple rules to your page with the
different prefixes on them.</p>

<h4>Opacity</h4>

<p>CSS 3 opacity is very easy to use—all you need to do is add an
<code>opacity</code> proprety to your rule, with a single value to
specify the opacity of the element(s) you are selecting. For
example:</p>

<pre>div { opacity: .7; }</pre>

<p>Check out this <a href="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/418/opacity.html" title="An opaque HTML blocklaid over another one">opacity example</a>, which shows a
semi-transparent block laid over the rest of the page. The Opera
Developer Network article <a href="../css-and-opacity-methods-for-creating-tr/index.html">CSS and opacity: methods for creating translucent elements</a> has worked examples of using the <code>opacity</code>
property in the real world.</p>

<h4>HSL</h4>

<p>CSS 3 allows you to specify colours as HSL (or Hue, Saturation,
Lightness) values. HSL colours overcome some of the
limitations of RGB colours such as being difficult to predict how to change the colour. HSL colours are specified like so:</p>

<pre>div { background-color: hsl(240, 100%, 50%); }</pre>

<p>It is also easy to convert RGB colours into HSL. <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#hsl-color" title="CSS 3 colormodule section on HSL">Check out the CSS 3 color module</a> for more
details on this. By way of an example, I’ve <a href="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/418/HSLcolour.html">rewritten the opacity example
using HSL colour</a>. In this version the absolutely positioned block’s
background colour is set using an HSL value, and a lighter paragraph is
added, which simply has the lightness values increased to create a
ligher shade. To change the colour, you can change the hue value.</p>


<h4>overflow-x and overflow-y</h4>

<p>these properties allow you to control how children will behave when
they flow out of their containing parent box; <code>overflow-x</code>
controls overflow out of the right and left, and <code>overflow-y</code>
controls overflow out of the top and bottom. The possible values of
these properties are as follows:</p>

<ul> 
    <li><code>visible</code>: The child content will flow beyond the
edge of the containing parent.</li> 
    <li><code>hidden</code>: Only the child content that can naturally be displayed edge within the confines of the containing parent is visible.</li>
    <li><code>scroll</code>: This creates the same effect as
<code>hidden</code>, with the addition of scroll bars to allow you to
scroll to see the rest of the content.</li> 
    <li><code>auto</code>: Similar to <code>scroll</code>, but scroll bars are only shown when
necessary.</li> 
    <li><code>no-display</code>: If the child content flows
over the edge of the containing parent, the whole lot is removed, as if
<code>display: none</code> were specified.</li>
    <li><code>no-content</code>: If the child content flows over the edge of
the containing parent, the whole lot is hidden, as if <code>visibility:
hidden</code> were specified.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Note that you can also set a property called just
<code>overflow</code>, which acts as shorthand for
<code>overflow-x</code> and <code>overflow-y</code>. See the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-box/#overflow" title="CSS 3overflow">CSS 3 box model specification</a> for more details and some
examples.</p>

<h4>nav-index, nav-up, nav-down, nav-left and nav-right</h4>

<p>These properties allow you to specify which element will be given
focus when the user presses navigation keys on the keyboard, for any
element you like (ie, you might want focus to be able to move from a
central element only to the four elements that immediately surround it,
using the keyboard). The spec doesn’t define what key to use for each,
but suggests the direction arrows should be used by user agents, and
that they should provide a means to left users set their own custom
keys. Opera actually uses this for spatial navigation—it’s used by
pressing Shift + the arrow keys on the desktop browser.</p>

<p>These properties are especially useful when absolute positioning is
used and the elements may not be displayed in source order. Check out
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-ui/#nav-dir" title="CSS nav keyproperties">CSS 3 UI module</a> for more information and an example.</p>

<h4>The first-of-type selector</h4>

<p>A popular way to add drop caps is to put a span around the first
letter, or add a class to the paragraph you want to add the drop cap to
and use the <code>::firstletter</code> pseudo-element to manipulate the
drop cap (the class is needed as it isn’t always predictable where the
element will be in the code; there could be a image or a list before the
first paragraph for example, which could throw things off.)  But no more
do we have to suffer this hassle—you can now create a drop cap (among
many other things) with the <code>first-of-type</code> selector.</p>

<p>Check out the following code:</p>

<pre>div.article &gt; p:firstof-type::firstletter { }</pre>


<p>This selects the first letter of the first <code>p</code> element
that is a direct child of the <code>div</code> element with a class of
<code>article</code>.  If there are any other elements before the first
paragraph of the article, the correct element will still be selected. 
It ignores any paragraphs that are not a direct descendent, such as
those contained in <code>div</code> elements.  This can be seen in this
<a href="http://files.myopera.com/dstorey/experiments/dropcaps.html">drop caps example</a>.</p>

<h4>The nth child/nth-of-type selector</h4>

<p>Alternating the background colour of the rows in a data table has
been a popular usability technique for a few years now—it allows the eye
to follow the rows more easily.  This traditionally required JavaScript
or adding a class name to each row that needed to be styled with the
alternative colour, but no more!  This can now be done with
<code>nth-child</code> (or <code>nth-of-type</code>).</p>



<p>In the following example (<a href="http://files.myopera.com/dstorey/experiments/iTunesTable.html">nth-child example in
action</a>) the striped effect can be created by simply using:</p>



<pre>#playlist tr:nthchild(odd) td {  background-color: #edf3fe; }
</pre>


<p>Alternatively <code>nth-child(even)</code> could have been used.  You
can have exact control over which element is selected, by specifying the
element number, the repeating pattern you want and/or the element offset
value.  For example, <code>tr:nthchild(2)</code> would specify the
second row only, <code>tr:nthchild(3n)</code> would select every third
row, while <code>tr:nthchild(3n+1)</code> would select every third row
offset by one.</p> <p>The Opera Developer Network article <a href="../zebra-striping-tables-with-css3/index.html">Zebra striping tables with CSS 3</a> has more information on this
technique.</p>

<h4>Form pseudo-classes</h4>

<p>You can now use pseudo-classes to select specific form elements in
different states, such as <code>:disabled</code> , <code>:enabled</code>,
etc., which allows for usability advantages like greying out disabled
form fields or highlighting checked boxes. </p>
<p>For example, you can write rules such as</p>
<pre>input:disabled  {background:gray } <br />
input:checked  {background-color:yellow;}</pre>
<p>Read
    this article for <a href="../styling-forms-with-attribute-selectors-1/index.html">more on styling form elements with form
        pseudo-classes</a>.</p>
<h4>Other CSS 3 selectors</h4>

<p>Opera Presto 2.1  features a fast, streamlined XML and XSLT processor,
which boasts full support for XSLT 1.0, XPath 1.0, XML events, XML
namespaces and the <code>xml:id</code>  and <code>xml:base</code>  attributes. Read more about <a href="http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/opera95/#xml" title="Opera 9 XMLsupport">Opera Presto 2.1’s XML support</a>.</p>

<h3 id="html5">HTML 5</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/" title="The current HTML 5 working draft">HTML 5</a> is the next
generation of HTML language, currently in working draft form—it aims to
improve on the semantics of HTML 4, get rid of some of its ambiguities,
and provide a better language for creating modern applications. After
all, HTML was never originally intended for creating dynamic web
applications—it was originally intended for static documents. </p>

<p>In addition, HTML is under threat of being usurped from its position as
&quot;language of the Web&quot; by proprietary technologies. In order for HTML to
stay competitive with proprietary technologies and to keep the Web open,
it needs new functionality and even better interoperability between the
various browser vendors. HTML 5 adds new functionality and provides
browser vendors with watertight definitions to follow.</p>

<p>Opera Presto 2.1 supports some proposed HTML 5 features. In this section I will look at
some of those features, along with some examples.</p>

<h4>Web Forms 2.0</h4>

<p>Web Forms 2.0 go a long way towards improving the usability,
simplicity and robustness of HTML forms—the semantics are better, they
are easier to style, and some stuff that used to require scripting has
been handled by some special built-in attributes. Let’s look at some
examples.</p>

<p>Validation can now be handled automatically using specialist
attributes. Take a look at the following:</p>

<pre>&lt;form&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;label&gt;Name: &lt;input name=&quot;name&quot; required=&quot;required&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;label&gt;E-mail: &lt;input name=&quot;email&quot; type=&quot;email&quot; required=&quot;required&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;label&gt;URL: &lt;input name=&quot;url&quot; type=&quot;url&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;label&gt;Comment: &lt;textarea name=&quot;comment&quot; required=&quot;required&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;React!&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</pre>

<p>This is very logical, even to a developer who has never seen HTML 5
before—the <code>url</code>, <code>email</code> etc keywords dictate
what type of string should be entered for the field to validate, and the
<code>required</code> keyword specifies whether the field should be
mandatory or not.</p>

<p>Styling form controls is now easier using the new pseudo-classes
recognised in HTML 5—for example:</p>

<pre>input:required { background:yellow; }</pre>

<p>You can do the same type of thing for the default submit button, read-only controls, like
this:</p>

<pre>
input[type=button]:default {border-width:1px; }
input:readonly {border-width:2px; border-color:ff000; }</pre>

<p>Combo boxes are now a lot more logical to create. An HTML 5 combo box
looks like this:</p>

<pre>&lt;input list=&quot;drinks&quot; name=&quot;drinks&quot;&gt;
&lt;datalist id=&quot;drinks&quot;&gt;
  &lt;option value=&quot;Tea&quot;&gt;&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=&quot;Coffee&quot;&gt;&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=&quot;Beer&quot;&gt;&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=&quot;Smoothie&quot;&gt;&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option value=&quot;Water&quot;&gt;&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/datalist&gt;</pre>
<p>It will degrade to a commmon text field in browsers that do not
support HTML 5, but in ones that do, it will allow the user to choose
the options in a drop down box or <strong>enter their own
value</strong>—click into the input field in this <a href="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/418/webFormsExample.html">Web Forms 2.0 combo box example</a>.</p>

<p>The last thing I’ll cover is giving auto focus to a certain form
element. Whereas before this required scripting, in HTML 5 you can just
put an <code>autofocus</code> attribute on to the form element you want
to give focus to first, eg <code>&lt;input name=search
autofocus&gt;</code>.</p>

Dixit</a>.</p>

<h4>Server-sent events</h4>

<p>Traditional Ajax applications tend to involve the clients putting a
lot of strain on the server by continuously polling it. Server-sent
events provide a mechanism by which you can continuously push events
from server to client via a persistent connection, which reduces the
load, and still allows instant feedback to the user. This type of
interaction has been done by various different means over the years under the umbrella term &quot;Comet&quot;; Comet methods have
traditionally had many issues however, and server-sent events aim to
solve some of those issues. For more about Comet, check out the <a href="http://cometdaily.com/" title="Comet daily Comet programmingexperiements">Comet Daily site</a> here, or this <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/simon/comet-at-the-highland-fling/" title="Comet presentation form the highland fling 2008">very informative
Comet presentation by Simon Willison</a>.</p>

<p>Arve Bersvendsen has written more about the <a href="http://my.opera.com/WebApplications/blog/show.dml/438711" title="Presto 2.1  server sent events">Opera Presto 2.1 Server-sent events
implementation</a>  plus a cool example. Bear in mind that the spec
actually changed after we implemented Server-sent events
(<code>event-source</code>); we will update our implementation when the
specification is finalised.</p>

<h4>Canvas</h4>

<p>HTML 5 canvas is a drawing API that uses a special HTML element to
define a drawing area, and scripting to draw graphics inside that area.
Creating a canvas requires you to use the
<code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>—simple as that:</p>

<pre>&lt;canvas id=&quot;example&quot; width=&quot;260&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;&gt;
There is supposed to be an example drawing here, but it&#39;s not important.
&lt;/canvas&gt;</pre>


<p>The <code>id</code> is used as a hook for the script to identify the
canvas and draw something inside it, the <code>width</code> and
<code>height</code> simply define the size of the canvas area, and the
text inbetween the tags specifies a fallback message to display in case
the canvas doesn’t work in the browser viewing the page (you could
specify a static image too if you wished). To actually draw something
inside the canvas, you need to use script, as shown in the following
example:</p>

<pre>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;HTML 5 Canvas example&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      function drawPicture(){
        var canvas = document.getElementById(&#39;example&#39;);
        
        var context = canvas.getContext(&#39;2d&#39;);
        
        context.fillStyle = &quot;rgb(0,255,0)&quot;;
        context.fillRect (25, 25, 100, 100);
        
        context.fillStyle = &quot;rgba(255,0,0, 0.6)&quot;;
        context.beginPath();
        context.arc(125,100,50,0,Math.PI*2,true);
        context.fill();
        
        context.fillStyle = &quot;rgba(0,0,255,0.6)&quot;;
        context.beginPath();
        context.moveTo(125,100);
        context.lineTo(175,50);
        context.lineTo(225,150);
        context.fill();
        
      }
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
      canvas { border: 2px solid black; }
    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body onload=&quot;drawPicture();&quot;&gt;
    &lt;canvas id=&quot;example&quot; width=&quot;260&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;&gt;
    There is supposed to be an example drawing here, but it&#39;s not important.
    &lt;/canvas&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

<p>View the <a href="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/418/canvasExample.html" title="Basic canvasexample">basic canvas example</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>getContext()</code> Canvas DOM method is used to get the
context (in this case it’s 2D), and the two lines below it are fairly
self explanatory—the <code>fillStyle</code> method specifies what color
the shape I’m going to draw will be, using an rgb value (you could also
use hex values or colour keywords, and you can also specify rgba values
to include opacity too, as I’ve done with the other two shapes.) The
<code>fillRect</code> method specifies a filled rectangle to be filled
with that colour—the parameters from left to right are x and y
coordinates relative to the origin 0,0 (the top left hand corner
of the canvas), and the width and height of the rectangle.</p>

<p>The rectangle is the only shape primitive specified by the Canvas API
however—other similar shapes have to be drawn using curves and lines,
which is what I have done for the circle and the triangle. In each case,
I set the fill colour, including opacity this time, specify that I’m
beginning to draw a shape using <code>beginPath()</code>, draw the shape
I want, then use <code>fill()</code> to close the shape and fill it. The
other methods are as follows:</p>

<ul> 
	<li><code>arc()</code>: Draws a circle, or part of a circle. The
parameters (L-R) are the x and y coordinates or the centre of the arc,
the arc’s radius, the start and end angles of the arc, and a boolean
value to specify whether the arc should be drawn clockwise
(<code>false</code>) or anticlockwise (<code>true</code>).</li>
	<li><code>moveTo()</code>: Moves the pen to the specified x and y
coordinates.</li> 
	<li><code>lineTo()</code>: Draws a line from where the
pen is currently positioned, to a new position specified by the x and y
coordinates.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Canvas also allows manipulation of images, transformations,
composition, animation, and all manner of other wonderful things.</p>

<p>You can find a very interesting <a href="../blob-sallad-canvas-tag-and-javascrip/index.html" title="canvas animation and physics example">Canvas example
that uses physics simulation and animation</a>, and some nice <a href="http://virtuelvis.com/2005/12/image-manipulation-in-canvas/">examples of Canvas
colour manipulation</a>.</p>

<h4>Cross document messaging</h4>

<p>Cross document messaging is an HTML feature that allows you to easily
send messages between web pages that are hosted on different domains.</p>

<h4>getElementsByClassName</h4>

<p>At last, that DOM method we’ve all been waiting for has been
introduced in HTML 5. Most JavaScript libraries now implement a
shorthand command that does something similar, but it is nice to be able
to do it natively.</p>


<h3 id="svg">SVG</h3>

<p>SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a web standard for representing
vector graphics in markup—it is a fantastic technology, which, in
conjunction with other web standards, provides you with mechanisms for
creating shapes, animation, text user interaction and more. In fact, it
can give Flash a run for its money, and it’s all open. Currently Opera
leads the way in terms of SVG support, with Safari/WebKit following, and
then Firefox a bit further behind them. We can only hope that other
major browsers will follow suit soon (we’re looking at you, Internet
Explorer.)</p>

<p>Presto 2.1  supports a pretty complete set of SVG 1.1 features (with
a few minor exceptions). In addition, it supports some features of SVG
1.2—such as SVG 1.2 Tiny’s vector effects (eg non-scaling stroke),
keyboard navigation, handler, and editable text as seen in the examples
below. Check out the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGMobile12/" title="SVG Tiny spec">SVG Tiny 1.2 spec</a> for more details.</p>

<p>
With the pleasantries out of the way, let’s go on to look at some SVG
examples.</p>

<h4>Decorating your pages using SVG backgrounds</h4>

<p>A very nice feature in Opera Presto 2.1  is the ability to use a SVG image
as the source of an <code>img</code> element, or even add SVG to a page
with CSS using the <code>background-image</code> and
<code>list-style-image</code> properties, just like you would regular
images. Try this out yourself! </p>
<p>Because SVG is fully
    scriptable, you can have all kinds of
    fascinating background animations, without having to resort to Flash or
    lots of complicated code.</p>
<h4>SVG for text</h4>

<p>SVG has all the functionality you’d ever need for creating rich
internet applications, complete with great looking form fields for
entering data. You can easily create simple form fields like so:</p>

<p><object width="850px" data="index.html" type="image/svg+xml" height="300px"></object></p>

<p>This requires the following simple code:</p>

<pre>  &lt;rect x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; fill=&quot;#87ceeb&quot;&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;background rectangle&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/rect&gt;

   &lt;g id=&quot;nameInput&quot; transform=&quot;scale(4) translate(50, 20)&quot;&gt;
      &lt;text x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;20&quot; font-size=&quot;18&quot; font-family=&quot;Arial, sans-serif&quot; fill=&quot;#000080&quot;&gt;Name:&lt;/text&gt;
      &lt;rect x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;25&quot; width=&quot;156&quot; height=&quot;26&quot; rx=&quot;3&quot; ry=&quot;3&quot;
         fill=&quot;white&quot; stroke-width=&quot;2&quot; stroke=&quot;#000080&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;textArea x=&quot;3&quot; y=&quot;27&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; height=&quot;20&quot; font-size=&quot;18&quot; font-family=&quot;Arial, sans-serif&quot;
         editable=&quot;simple&quot; focusable=&quot;true&quot; pointer-events=&quot;boundingBox&quot;&gt;John Doe&lt;/textArea&gt;
   &lt;/g&gt;</pre>

<p>Or go a bit crazy, like this (check out the <a href="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/418/text2.svg" title="crazy text field SVG">crazy SVG text field example</a> then view
source to check out the source code):</p>

<p><object width="600px" data="index.html" type="image/svg+xml" height="600px"></object></p>

<h4>SVG Animation and image manipulation</h4>

<p>Again, SVG is full equipped for animation/image manipulation. You can
include images in an SVG file easily enough, draw complex shapes with
SVG, or even include SVG files inside the HTML 5 Canvas, as shown in
this <a href="http://files.myopera.com/MacDev_ed/sarpsborg2007/canvas2d.html" title="resizing imges in SVG">Image resizing example from Erik
Dahlström</a>. You simply pass an <code>Image</code> object to
<code>drawImage</code> that points to an SVG file.</p>

<p>I just had to include this <a href="http://my.opera.com/MacDev_ed/blog/2008/05/18/timetravel">time travel animation example</a>, again from
Erik. As Erik explains on his blog, this currently tends to freeze
Safari and Firefox, so only an image is included below. This makes use of
SVG animation, and the FakeSMILe (partial javascript implementation
of SMIL) library for browsers with less advanced SVG supportext1.svgt than Opera Presto 2.1 offers. Check out the source of this example—it is amazing how
    litle script is needed for this animation, compared to how much it would
be to do it in JavaScript alone.</p>

<img alt="image of Erik Ds time travel SVG example" src="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/510/timetravel.jpg" />
<p>SVG animate motion</p>

<p>I can however include Erik’s example showing how to create an
advanced SVG menu using opacity, matrices, and other cool effects:</p>

<p><object width="100%" data="index.html" type="image/svg+xml" height="335"><img alt="fall back image for SVG menu" src="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/510/vistamen.jpg" /> </object></p>

<h3 id="aria">WAI-ARIA</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria" title="the Accessible RichInternet Applications Suite">WAI-ARIA</a> (the Accessible Rich Internet
Applications Suite) is a W3C specification that aims to define how to
make Rich Internet Application technologies such as Ajax accessible, by
filling in the accessibility gaps in the Ajax model. Opera Presto 2.1 
experimentally supports an ARIA implementation, but the specification is
still changing.</p>

is used.</p>

<h3 id="operawidgets">Opera Widgets</h3>

<p>Opera Widgets are applications written using Web standards, which are
specially packaged and run on the desktop. They have their own security
model, can be run across different platforms and devices (including
mobile devices) and have some exciting features available such as the <a href="../../../libraries/widgetobject/docs/widget.dml.html" title="The Opera Widgets API">Opera Widget API</a>, which allows all
