<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Every web designer should know and understand a Web site’s parameters before lifting a finger to start designing the site. In this

article, you will learn the basics required to start designing business Web sites. While this information is useful if you want to build sites for others, it can also serve as a checklist

article for sites you want to build for yourself. This is usually the stage that comes after <a href="../6-information-architecture-planning-o/index.html" title="Information architecture article">information architecture</a>—you should collect information on what the client wants on their site and how it should be structured, what kind of branding that company uses, and then use that information to build up a visual design mockup that you can ok with the client before you add graphics and colour schemes on to it.  Specifically, I’ll cover the following:</p>



<ul>

<li>Although colour and design are important, you need to understand what the client wants to accomplish with his or her Web site. This information will have a heavy bearing on the site’s look and feel.</li>



<li>You therefore need to manage a checklist of items to learn about the client’s Web site before the design is attempted.</li>



<li>You also need to know more about the company’s previous marketing efforts, including branding. This information will have a bearing on the Web site design.</li>



<li>Based upon all the information gathered from the client, you will create the visual design for the site so that the client can visualize the foundation for his additional graphics and content.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="whattoknow">What you need to know</h2>

<p>Usually before a Web site design is decided upon, the individual or business should have a plan in place about what the Web site should accomplish. While colour and graphics are important, a plan should be in place for a budget, the intended market and projected goals as well as resources to accomplish these tasks. Is the site just going to give the user information, or is it intended to sell them products or services as well? Will this Web site expand, or is it intended to be a short-term effort to reach a niche market (such as a political campaign site or a site that intends to tap in on a current trend). Will the site include a blog,  legal and information pages, photo gallery, e-mail contact form? What else does it need? How does this site compare to the competition?</p>



<p>Last, but not least among all these questions, is whether the company has a brand in place along with marketing guidelines. If not, then this job needs attention before a Web site design is attempted. The logo, branding of merchandise or services intended for a specific market, and a means to reach that market may be beyond your skills. If you haven’t attempted this task before, you might pull in an expert in marketing to help set this business in the right direction. On the other hand, if a plan already is in place, then it’s important to follow the company’s directives so the Web site will fall in place with other marketing materials.</p>



<p>While much of this information may be decided before the proposed site reaches the designer, the answers to these questions can help you decide what type of site to design, the colours to use and the type of graphics to include. But, one thing can be determined up front in most cases—the site should be accessible and usable. Therefore, attention to code and to navigation is a priority in all cases. You can read more about accessibility later in this course (the main accessibility articles are still to be published), and some further points about usability issues from <a href="http://www.useit.com/" title="Jakob Nielsens homepage">Jakob Nielsen</a>.</p>



<p>The point is to keep the site simple by using HTML and CSS for

code and design, respectively. Avoid Flash unless it is appropriate for some elements of the site  (much

has been done to <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/article/accessible-flash-parts-1-2" title="Accessible Flash article">make Flash more accessible</a> of late, and it is good for some tasks, such as video), and think about where JavaScript and other technical stuff is needed. This will make the site design easier for the

designer and programmer to create (especially if the designer <em>is</em>

the programmer) and it will be more compatible across all browsers.</p>



<h2 id="firststeps">The first steps</h2>



<p>To help you along with these issues, I’ll build a simple

business site using a set of guidelines that I use for designing Web

sites for myself and others. These checklists will include business

aspects as well as design issues. For convenience, I’ll use an

imaginary business that is already developed, so it has used marketing

materials in the past. Printed materials, including a logo and branding

are already in place. If you’re starting from scratch, the logo and

branding plans will need to be developed first before you begin to

develop the Web site.</p>



<p>As a Web designer, I’ll want to know the following information

about a business before I begin the site design. I want to make a list

of everything that I want on that site design so I don’t need to make

radical changes later. This is not an imaginary situation, as the

topics below need to be discussed with the business owners/decision

makers to make sure that your vision of the project is in line with

their vision.</p>



<ol>



<li>Web site name: Does the

name reflect the company and its online efforts? In this case, the Web

site name is the company name, which is “Wiki Whatevers.” The company

may want to develop a <a href="http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol112/tagline.htm" title="developing a tag line for your product">tag

line</a> as well if they don’t already use one. The tag line will

then be placed with the company name and logo together on the Web page.</li>



<li>Logo and branding: I want to

collect any printed matter that was developed prior to this task,

including logo, brochures, etc, so I can build a file that will hold

information such as phone numbers and addresses. These items will also

help me to understand the &quot;tone&quot;, branding and style of this business

better from their past efforts. If none of this has been developed

previously, then I’ll want to hire a logo design team to build a logo (I’m

not a logo designer, so I farm that work out—and you can as well by

building that price into your billing).</li>



<li>Web site domain name: In tandem

with the Web site name, I want to know if the domain name is available.

The domain name is the address that a Web site uses for identification,

and that the user will type into a browser’s address bar to reach that

Web site. The domain name also is used as the link to the Web site from

outside resources. The domain name can carry any number of <a href="http://www.ipowerweb.com/hostingdictionary/" title="dictionary of web hosting">upper level domain registrations</a>, such as “.com,” “.org,” and so on. While a designer usually isn’t responsible for the domain name

registration, it helps to know if the domain name has been chosen and

registered. In some cases I’ve had to change a domain site name and
some site content because the domain name was unavailable. This problem led

to a higher charge for the client, which would have been unnecessary

had the domain name been chosen first.</li>



<li>Competititon research: It helps

to know what competitors’ Web sites contain in terms of graphics and

content so that the site you design will enter the market on an equal

or better footing than the company’s main competitors.</li>



<li>Information architecture: Does the site

need a shopping cart or a blog? What plans for expansion does the site

owner have in mind? What structure would be best to link the pages together? These items are important, as you will need to

build them into the site design and its navigation. You need to know

how the site will expand in the future—this will determine how you build the

site as well.</li>



<li>Site content: Has the site

content been developed? If so, you’ll want to gain access to the

content immediately to help determine the navigation, type design, and

layout. Categorizing the content is the best way to develop navigation.

The content can help determine the look and feel of the site as well;

therefore, if content hasn’t been developed, it might be wise to delay

the design. Be sure that the content is relevant and plan for updates,

as site content is what keeps visitors returning to a site.</li>



<li>Research web hosts: While the client may have a

particular Web host provider in mind, you may need something else entirely as

not all hosts provide equal technology support. A Web host is the business that hosts Web sites, and some Web hosts provide

access to databases, which you may need for a blog or for cataloging

information or products through a shopping cart. Other hosts limit the

number of visitors to a site, and this can create problems if the site

becomes popular. For a large list of Web hosting providers and their

capabilities, visit the Web Host Database (<a href="http://whdb.com/" title="web host database homepage">WHDb</a>).

Make sure the client has purchased space on this Web host before you

begin your site design so that you know your design parameters.</li>



<li>Directed departure:

Planning for directed departure means that you/your client gains control

over how users will leave the site. Viewers will leave the Web site

eventually, so why not plan for their departure through monetized ad

placement or through link exchanges? Making plans for this direction

now can add value to the site monetarily and/or through offering a

service to your site users.</li>



<li>Deadlines:

Determine now when the site will go “live”. Usually an eight-week lead

time is enough to finalize any small project such as this, as long as

the clients have their content ready, they are amenable to colour and

layout designs you offer as samples, and no difficult programming is

required.</li>



</ol>



<p>Once you have these basics out of the way, you

can sit down, read the content, plan for navigation and decide how to

best optimize the site for search engines. While you might not be in

charge of SEO (Search Engine Optimization), you can work closely with

an SEO expert to determine how best to use the <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/article/ultimate-seo-checklist" title="SEO checklist">site’s

content and your code</a> to generate more traffic via keywords

in content and in headings and subheadings.</p>



<p>Just as you wouldn’t pick out carpets or a couch

for a new home before the architect has created the blueprint, neither

would you create a visual design for the site until you’ve planned the

site’s architecture. The navigation and plans for <a href="http://www.seochat.com/" title="SEO focused resource site">SEO</a> in this initial

stage will save time and headaches down the road. By the time you’re

ready to create a visual plan, you’re already familiar with the site’s

direction and its contents, and this makes the job of working with

colour and graphics that much easier.</p>



<h3 id="imaginarysite">The imaginary example site</h3>



<p>This imaginary site is a business that provides

Open Source code for wikis, and they come up with at least three new code ideas per week. Since the code is free to use and modify,

the site owners want to monetize the site (generate money from it) through donations, ad

placement, and through extra services offered by their programmers. The

site name is “Wiki Whatevers,” and the domain name has been chosen. The

content has been developed, and it contains code snippets that need to

be cataloged, articles, and bios that feature the programmers involved

with this project. The Web host provides <a href="http://www.mysql.com/" title="mysql home page">MySQL</a> database

availability, and it is geared to accept the heaviest of surges in

traffic without down time. Now it’s time to pull together the items

that will be used on the site:</p>







<ol>



<li>Using the company’s pre-existing

logo, I want to prepare a digital copy to use throughout the client’s

Web site. I&#39;ll need a scanner to scan the image into a graphic program

such as <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/index.html" title="photoshop home page">Photoshop</a>

or <a href="http://www.gimp.org/" title="The gimp open source graphics package">Gimp</a>. I’ll

size the logo for the site later, once I’ve determined the layout. I’ll

save the image at 72 dpi, which will allow for faster download time. I

probably will use this logo for #4 below as well.</li>



<li>I’ll use photos of the programmers on the staff

page (or “About&quot; page), so I’ll need digital images for this project. They will either

provide photos for scanning or send digital images. If they send

digital images, I’ll want an image with more detail than I’ll eventually use, so a 300 dpi image is good, or a full-sized image that I can reduce later to my own specifications.</li>



<li> The client has decided to use a blog, since they already have sufficient content to keep this blog active for the next few months. Fortunately, the client has chosen a Web host provider that

is familiar with blogs and has the necessary capabilities to handle

databases and high traffic—including spikes in traffic. This host also provides several solutions

for expansion, a great offer if the client wants to grow. If the host’s

up time is guaranteed, the client will be happier if he or she can stay

with the same host throughout this growth phase down the road. This

ability to stay with a host provider for years makes life much simpler.</li>



<li>Using FTP (there are several to choose from on

the market, such as the Open Source products <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/" title="filezilla home page">Filezilla</a>, or

<a href="http://fireftp.mozdev.org/" title="fireftp home page">fireftp</a> for

Firefox, or a proprietary client such as <a href="http://www.cuteftp.com/" title="cute ftp home page">CuteFTP</a>), I’ll

upload a static page that announces the upcoming site. “Under

Construction” is a terrible phrase to use, as visitors to the site may

not return if they don’t know your “grand opening” date. Instead, use a

page that states the name of the company, what they will offer, a date

that the site will be active, and a contact (email is fine—if this is

a bricks-and-mortar business, use a street address and phone number as

well). Even better, utilize an email form that individuals can use to

be notified when the site goes live. This last suggestion provides

clients with potential consumers even before the site opens for

business.</li>



<li>Using the content/structure information received from the client and

the fact that they want advertising space designed into all pages, I’ll
design the architecture for the site and plan the navigation and

textual links. I’ll also use this copy to plan for keywords for the

site’s SEO.</li>



<li>Using the colours in the logo, I’ll choose two or

three colour schemes to present to the client for approval.</li>



<li>Then, I’ll choose other photographs or

illustrations from a stock photo place such as <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/index.php" title="istock homepage">iStock</a>

or <a href="http://www.comstock.com/web/default.asp" title="comstock homepage">Comstock</a>.

But, be sure to shop around, as some stock photo businesses offer sales

and other deals that you may not be able to pass up. Using stock

photography is not that expensive, and it saves headaches concerning <a href="http://www.templetons.com/brad/copymyths.html" titles="debunking myths about copyright law">copyright

issues</a>. I’ll also need any images that the company has produced—or that they will produce—to accompany any code, &quot;how-to&quot; articles and blog entries.</li>



</ol>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> These last two steps will be covered in the next article in the series; bear in mind that you want to get approval from the client for the visual mockup layout before you start putting colours and graphics all over it!</p>



<h3 id="brandlogo">The logo</h3>



<p>The logo is a vital part of any company’s

branding. While most businesses will not rush a logo as this piece of

artwork will represent their business for many years, other clients

will be less concerned with the image that represents a company. I can

tell you from experience that a company that doesn’t spend time and

money on a professional logo usually will never spend that money—no

matter how logical your arguments to the contrary.</p>



<p>The Wiki Whatevers company owners all attended

Georgia Tech, so they used their Alma Mater’s colours—gold and black—in the logo design. But, while the logo is simplistic, at least it may prove

easy to work with in colour and layout. Figure 1 shows the logo:</p>



<img style="width: 300px; height: 160px;" alt="Wiki Whatevers logo" src="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/361/logo.jpg" />

<p class="comment">Figure 1: The Wiki Whatevers logo.</p>



<p>The issue here is that I just

scanned in a print logo, wanting to use the same logo online.

The print colours, which are <a href="http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/g/cmyk.htm" title="CMYK definition">CMYK</a>

(Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Key, or black), will not match the Web

colours that consist of RGB (Red, Green, Blue). So, I’ll need to try to

do a little colour matching to get the Web colours to match the logo as

closely as possible. There are four ways to accomplish this goal:</p>



<ol>

<li>Contact the printer to ask what

colours were used to print the Wiki Whatevers logo on previous printed

matter. Usually, the printer will use <a href="http://www.pantone.com/pages/pantone/index.aspx" title="pantone colours">Pantone</a>

colours, and Pantone provides tools that help designers match print

colours to Web colours. This Pantone Colour Matching system is something

that the printer may have on hand, so that printer can help match the

print colours to the appropriate matching Web colour without spending

money on Pantone tools.</li>



<li>Since the guys who own Wiki Whatevers used

Georgia Tech’s colours, I can go to the Georgia Tech site to see if I

can match the colours from the Web. You can <a href="http://www.iopus.com/guides/screenshot.htm">use a graphic program to

extract a colour from a Web site by making a screenshot</a> and bringing that image into a graphic program to use an eyedropper or

some other tool to match the colours.</li>



<li>Eyeball the printed matter with the Web colours

to try to match as closely as possible. In some cases, the colours may

be vastly different. In other cases, the colours may seem too close to

warrant a change.</li>



<li>Scan the print image in a scanning program that

accepts CMYK and use Photoshop’s Pantone Colour Swatches to match as

closely as possible. This last solution works only if your scanner

accepts CMYK and you own Photoshop software.</li>



</ol>



<p>In my case, I was able to get that

gold to match perfectly from the mascot image at the <a href="http://ramblinwreck.cstv.com/" title="georgia tech athletic homepage">Georgia Tech Athletic

site</a>. The gold is #eab200, and the black is, well, black

(#000000). The background, which is a dark green-blue (#002123), was

used in the drop shadow in the logo. So, what could have been

problematic was made easy through a simple bumblebee mascot, as seen in

Figure 2:</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>Very

seldom will you run across a business that hasn’t used a digital image

of their logo or brand online for items such as business cards and

letterhead, if not for an actual Web presence. However, many of these

businesses seem to accept the colours that the Web presents, rather than

change the colours to match their printed matter. So, don’t always rely

on Web colours for a company’s site, especially if those colours don’t

match the company print matter such as brochures or letterhead.

Instead, ask the company which colours they prefer—they may not have

noticed that the colours were different in the first place.</p>


<h3 id="layout">The Layout</h3>

<p>For the layout, and for simplicity’s sake for this tutorial, I will demonstrate one layout. I chose a blog layout that promotes the most frequent changes to the body copy at top, easy access to navigation between the header and that recent body copy, and access to previous posts “below the fold” on the home page. The term “below the fold” originates from newspaper production. When a newspaper is on the stand, the reader will see only that copy placed “above the fold” in the newspaper (ie the physical fold in the paper). That copy—including images—is important, as it needs to entice the reader to purchase the paper.</p>

<p>The same “above the fold” theory applies to web site design. Anything that shows on a monitor when a visitor enters a site is “above the fold”. Any copy that a viewer needs to scroll down to view is “below the fold”. So, the trick is to keep a web site visitor’s attention with the first images and copy that they view on any monitor, no matter the resolution (which is just one good reason to test your web sites on a number of different monitors/screen resolutions—an issue addressed later in this article). A rough example for the initial layout for Wiki Whatevers is shown in Figure 3:</p>

<img style="width: 390px; height: 600px;" alt="Wireframe" src="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/361/wireframe.jpg" />

<p class="comment">Figure 3: Rough layout (wireframe) for the Wiki Whatevers home page</p>

<p>This layout will remain the same throughout the site, but may change for the archived pages to list the article and blog entries without images. The reason for this consistency is so the viewer doesn’t become confused. Once users “learn” how to use a site, they usually don’t like to see changes from page to page. Here is what this specific design will contain:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Header</strong>: The header is small, as I didn’t want to make the logo take up too much space on the page. While the logo is a minor feature, the colours within that logo will contribute to the overall colour scheme for the site. The header is at the top, a traditional placement, and the logo will link to the blog’s home page. Linkage from the logo is convenient and many users have become accustomed to using the logo as a means to return to the home page on any given site</li>

<li><strong>Navigation</strong>: Placed immediately below the header, the navigation is obvious and easy to use. This navigation also will be repeated in the footer. I repeat the navigation in the footer simply because I’m from the old school where navigation is repeated in simple text for those users who don’t display images in their browser. Since I&#39;m not sure at this point whether I’ll use images for the navigation at top, I automatically include textual navigation somewhere else on the page as well—usually in the footer. This text helps those <a href="http://www.afb.org/Section.asp?SectionID=57&amp;amp;TopicID=167&amp;∓DocumentID=2757">blind readers</a> who use a screen reader to “read” a Web page. Whether you place that navigation text at the top or the bottom of the page is irrelevant except to the design, as blind readers can scan a page from bottom to top and vice versa as quickly as a sighted person. With that said, it is up to the designer and his/her client whether or not to repeat the navigation anywhere on a given page. If you use images for navigation and do not repeat the navigation links in text, then be sure to include descriptive <code>alt</code> attributes for those navigation images. This way, users who use a screen reader or who turn off images will still know what those images are for. See the relevant section of article 17 for more about <a href="../17-images-in-html/index.html#alt">correct use of <code>alt</code> attributes</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Most recent blog entry</strong>: The most recent blog entry deserves highlighting, and the ability to make this entry a major focus on the page “above the fold” is advantageous to both the client and his readers. As soon as the viewer surfs to this site, this is the copy that he or she will see. This obvious placement, however, means that the client will need to continuously update the site on a consistent basis or risk losing return visitors —people are unlikely to keep returning to a blog if there is no new content being published on it.</li>

<li><strong>Previous blog entries</strong>: This is where previous blog entries will reside—about three to five entries should be enough to let viewers know, at a glance, exactly what to expect from this site on an ongoing basis. Images might be nice here but they are not necessary as this area is located below the fold, so it is not as important for catching the viewer’s eye. The decision to use images may be based on whether download time is an issue, or if the previous article actually needs an image to entice the viewer to click through to the full article/blog entry.</li>

<li><strong>Right column</strong>: This is where viewers can gain access to blog entries listed by category, archives, and other types of site content. Examples of other pages include an &quot;about the company&quot; page, a site index and contact information. It’s important to decide how you want to list these items in a side column, as the blog will build upon the categories you create, the pages you build and the archival material. As you grow the site, these lists will become longer, possibly to the point where —in this case—the categories may be the only list that a viewer will see “above the fold”. The clients may decide that the “pages” are more important than the categories, and the list shown above may be altered to place pages above categories. As a side note, this list does not include everything that can be included in a side bar or side column. Some clients may feel that two columns would be better, making the blog a three-column, rather than two-column blog as shown above.</li>

<li><strong>Footer information</strong>: Footer information is vital and important, as it provides viewers with background information about company and its Web site at a glance instead of having to dig for it. Company name, possibly a repeat of the logo, address, email address, links (to contact form, privacy notices, disclaimers, legal information), and news summaries are all good candidates for being included in the page footer. As mentioned before, you can also repeat the navigation as a text only version.</li>

<li><strong>Advertising</strong>: In this layout, the advertising is positioned following the recent blog entry and the previous blog entries in a horizontal banner. This provides the client with the flexibility of choosing ad text or banner art for their advertising needs. This type of layout for advertising places just one ad “above the fold” and another ad “below the fold”. This amount of advertising is plenty enough for most sites. Additionally, it relegates advertising to a secondary position, below the body copy for the site’s contents.</li></ol>

<p>This layout allows the viewer to quickly move from body copy to navigation without scrolling, and it also allows users to view other topics that the site may cover with further links into the site’s categories at the very least. Even if the viewer never scrolls down past the red “fold” line, the layout provides all the major elements that a viewer might need, all placed “above the fold. ”</p>

<h3 id="advertising">About Advertising on a Site</h3>

<p>It is to the client’s advantage, and a service to the reader if the advertising on a site is content-relevant. In other words, if the content on the site is about flowers, then ads for that site might include landscaping services, catering (to compliment floral arrangements), etc. So, for a site that provides open source materials, you might seek advertisers that are relevant to open source content. <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/">Google Adsense</a>, as one source, would help in this regard, as the ads are content-relative. The use of this type of advertising is a great idea until traffic grows enough to entice other advertisers to your site. However, always think about the SEO implications before you accept ads, as some advertising may adversely affect the client’s standing in search pages. Some good SEO resources are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../intelligent-site-structure-for-better-se/index.html">Intelligent site structure for better SEO!</a>, by Joost de Valk.</li>
<li><a href="../semantic-html-and-search-engine-optimiza/index.html">Semantic HTML and search engine optimization</a>, by Joost de Valk.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.clickz.com/showPage.html?page=3497826"> How Affiliate Programs Can Affect Search Rankings</a>, by Fredrick Marckini.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You may not be responsible for site advertising as a designer unless you&#39;re designing a site for yourself, but if you plan to work with an advertising or design agency in the future, you may want some input into the advertising at these design firms. The more you know about what makes a site successful, the more success you may encounter in your design career. When possible, learn as much as you can about marketing (for yourself and for your clients) and search engine optimization tactics.</p>

<h3 id="checklayout">Checking Layout with validation and the client</h3>

<p>Before this layout is implemented using code, I want to confirm the layout(s) (or wireframes) with the client. One tactic I use to convince the client that any one layout is better than the other is to remind them that coding additional layouts does cost money. This helps the client pick one layout, with the idea that the code can be tweaked later to make some structural changes.</p>

<p>The next step is to code the layout and then validate that code. I use the W3C <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">Markup Validation Service</a> and the W3C <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS Validation Service</a> to confirm that the HTML and CSS used to build the layout contains no errors. You can upload files directly from your computer to these validation services, so you don’t need to upload them to the client’s site to test them. This test allows the designer and/or the programmer to find any errors on the front end that can be resolved before the site becomes saturated with code from images, advertising and other items added to the pages.</p>

<p>Accessibility is another big concern—making sure the site is usable by people with disabilities such as blindness or motor deficiencies. This isn’t as easy a validation process as validating your CSS and HTML. There are checkers available, such as <a title="www." rel="tawdis.net/taw3/cms/en&quot;">TAWDIS</a>, but ideally you should test with real users and do a qualitative analysis of your sites for accessibility—a mechanized checker can’t conclusively say whether a site is accessible or not, although it can give some indication as to what is right and wrong. They sometimes make mistakes as well. There will be much more information about accessibility published in the next part of the course, so watch this space!</p>

<p>You should also test the layout across the different available browsers so that you know your web site can be viewed by the maximum number of web users possible. You can do this by having Mac, Windows, Linux and Mobile systems available, all with various browsers installed, or use emulators such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMware_Fusion">VMWare Fusion</a> to emulate different systems on one computer, but this is rather fiddly and longwinded. Another option is to use browser-capturing services such as <a href="http://www.browsercam.com/">BrowserCam</a>, as this service is fast, convenient, covers a number of different browser possibilities (including much older browsers). They offer a 24-hour free trial so you can see if this service is right for you, and after the free offer, the charge to use this service is worth it, especially if you design a large number of sites and test on a large number of different browsers.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s a good idea to check in with the client to let them know that the code has been generated for the layout and that it has been validated; you should also let them know how many changes were needed to the wireframe to get it to work across browsers. Only after the code is generated, validation finalized, and go-ahead from the client received should you begin to add colours, images, and any other code such as for advertising. Although this work may seem tedious, it’s best to confirm all the validation and get client approval before adding the icing on the cake. Otherwise, you may find yourself working harder than you want as you find code problems and browser incompatibilities after the fact. Additionally, any artwork or body copy can prove a distraction for the client when they are trying to review the actual architecture of the site.</p>

<p>Once you’ve completed this process, you can then begin to work on the site’s text, images, and colours. How do you begin to do this? Find out in the next article!</p>



<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>



<p>The web designer often wears many hats, because Web

site design is based upon many factors. Will that site grow over time,

or will it remain static? Can the Web host provide consistent quality service and room to grow, or will that client

need to move from Web host to Web host with new additions to the site?

And, if the designer cannot sufficiently perform all design issues,

does that designer have a network of people on hand to help?</p>



<p>So, beyond colour and graphics, a foundation

needs to be laid to build that Web site upon. The business of building

a site affects the design, and any issues that might become problems

down the road can be ironed out in the planning phases. This ability to

resolve issues before they arise makes for a professional designer.</p>



<p>Once the foundation has been laid and the

architecture and wireframe of the site has been developed, the designer then can

begin to work with colour schemes to develop the full Web site for

client approval.</p>
