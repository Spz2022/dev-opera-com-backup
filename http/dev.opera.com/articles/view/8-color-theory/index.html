<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Without much colour or graphics, every site would become <a href="http://www.useit.com/" title="Jakob Nielsens home page">Jakob Nielsen</a>’s
dream site. Although Nielsen’s philosophy of bare-bones Web
architecture has
accessibility and usability merits, most Web designers want to add a
signature touch to their sites
with many design elements. Fortunately, a designer can add colour to a
site without losing accessibility and usability if the site is designed
with those capabilities in mind. While many designers feel comfortable
designing a site for many users, those same designers might
feel&#xA0;inadequate when it comes to choosing colours and graphics.</p>

<p>In this article, I’ll cover colour basics and three simple
colour schemes
so that you can feel confident
about choosing colours for your site. I’ll follow up this article with
another piece on how to simplify these colour choices. After all, it’s
more fun to enjoy the compliments on your Web site design than it is to
sweat over the colour choices. The contents are as follows:</p>

<h2 id="colourtintshade">Colours, tints, and shades</h2>

<p>Colours, or hues, have historically been divided into primary,
secondary, and tertiary colours. The primary colours consist of red,
yellow and blue, and they’re called primary colours because you don’t
need to mix colours to make these three hues. If you want to translate
these colours into web
colours, you can recreate them using their hex (hexadecimal) equivalents
of #ff0000, #ffff00, and
#0033cc as shown in Figure 1:</p>

<p><img style="width: 390px; height: 296px;" alt="Primary Colours" src="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/358/1.primary.jpg" /></p>
<p class="comment">Figure 1: the primary and secondary
colours, and their hex equivalents</p>

<p>Secondary colours are mixed from primary colours, and those
colours are as
follows:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Red + Yellow = Orange (#ff9900)</li>

  <li>Yellow + Blue = Green (#00cc00)</li>

  <li>Blue + Red = Violet (#660099)</li>

</ul>

<p>Tertiary colours are mixed from the secondary colours, and they
lie
between the primary and secondary colours shown on the wheel above.
Although web colours differ from regular &quot;painters&quot; colours, it
might help to <a href="http://colorwheelco.com/">get hold of
a colour wheel</a> (as seen in Figure 2) to have at hand while you
learn
about various colour schemes. In addition, a colour wheel will show all
the
tints, tones and shades so you can begin to realize the colour
possibilities
you have at hand. Some more important terms to learn are as follows:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Tint &#x2013; The resulting colour when white is added</li>

  <li>Tone &#x2013; The resulting colour when gray is added</li>

  <li>Shade &#x2013; The resulting colour when black is added</li>

</ul>

<p><img style="width: 390px; height: 245px;" alt="Tints, tones and shades" src="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/358/2.tints.jpg" /></p>

<p class="comment">Figure 2: A real colour wheel</p>

<p>The arrows in Figure 2 indicate different things as follows:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Outermost band &#x2013; tertiary colour of yellow-orange
(yellow + orange)</li>

  <li>Second band &#x2013; the tint of that tertiary colour
(white added)</li>

  <li>Third band &#x2013; the tone of the colour (gray added)</li>

  <li>Innermost band &#x2013; shade on the print wheel (black
added)</li>

</ul>

<p>As you can see from the colour wheel shown above, the amount of
white,
gray and black added to a colour are minor—just enough to alter the
original
colour and to create what is known as a <strong>monochromatic
colour
scheme</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="monochromatic">Monochromatic colour schemes</h3>

<p>Colour schemes have been around for centuries, so there’s no
need to
reinvent the colour wheel. Although web colour differs from print
colour, the concepts
are the same. You just exchange hex numbers for colour names, and
match then as closely as possible. One online tool I suggest using to
help out with this is
the <a href="http://colorschemedesigner.com/">Color Scheme Designer</a>, as seen in Figure 3, which allows you to
determine colour schemes quickly and easily, and even
determine whether the colours you’ve chosen provide enough contrast for
low-vision or colour-blind users.</p>

<p><img style="width: 390px; height: 240px;" alt="Color Scheme Generator" src="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/358/3.generator.jpg" /></p>
<p class="comment">Figure 3: Color Scheme Generator II.</p>

<p class="note">If you want more help deciding whether the colours you&#39;ve chosen provide a good enough contrast, try out the <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrast-analyser.html">Contrast Analyser</a> from the Paciello Group. This tool checks the contrast between foreground and background colours.</p>

<p>To achieve the tint, tone and shade for the yellow-orange
colour at the
online colour generator, first select the colour that the arrow points to
in the image shown above. Then, select <strong>Mono</strong>
in the panel
located under the colour wheel and <strong>Default</strong>
in the panel in the box to the right. Also select <strong>Normal
Vision</strong> in the
selection from the pull-down menu at the bottom right. Do not check the
&quot;reduce to ‘safe’ colours&quot; box above the colour box unless you’re a
purist.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>The term &quot;web-safe colours&quot; comes from a time when monitors could display 256 colours, only 216 of which were the same across Windows/Mac/Unix platforms, hence the &quot;web safe&quot; monicker. While some purists still stick with the &quot;Web-safe colour palette&quot;, modern browsers are
capable of handling what is known as &quot;24-bit&quot; colour. Actual 24-bit
colour at ten to eleven bits per
channel produces 16,777,216 distinct colours. In other words,
it’s safe to say that the &quot;Web safe&quot; colour palette rarely is needed
anymore.</p>

<p>Back to the monochromatic colour scheme. The results you should
receive by following the steps described above are: yellow-orange
(#FFCC00),
tint
(#FFF2BF), tone (#FFE680), and shade (#B38F00). These hex numbers are
much more reliable than any guesses you will make by trying to match a
tangible colour wheel to the backlit screen of a Web browser. And, as
the &quot;Mono&quot; suggests, this scheme translates to a monochromatic colour
scheme, as seen in Figure 4.</p>

<p><img style="width: 390px; height: 25px;" alt="Monochromatic colour scheme" src="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/358/4.mono_1.jpg" /></p>
<p class="comment">Figure 4: A monochromatic colour scheme.</p>

<p><strong>A monochromatic colour scheme</strong>
equates to one colour and all its tints,
tones and shades. While this scheme is the easiest to use, it doesn’t
provide much excitement in a Web design for many designers. Instead,
you may want to
explore other schemes to add pizzaz to your links, images, and banners.
</p>

<h3 id="complementary">Complementary Colour Schemes</h3>

<p>The next
colour scheme family to explore is the complementary scheme, where you
match up colours that lie
directly opposite each other on the colour wheel, as seen in Figure 5.</p>

<p><img style="width: 390px; height: 99px;" alt="Complementary colour schemes" src="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/358/5.complementary.jpg" /></p>
<p class="comment">Figure 5: Examples of complementary
colour schemes.</p>

<p>When you choose one colour and its opposite colour, you also
include all
the tints, tones and shades of both colours. This provides a wider range
of choices, and it translates well with the online colour tool—see
Figure 6.</p>

<p><img style="width: 390px; height: 240px;" alt="Online complementary colour scheme" src="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/358/6.complementary_2.jpg" /></p>
<p class="comment">Figure 6: A complementary colour scheme
inside the online colour tool.</p>

<p>In the image above, I have chosen an orange colour with the
opposite
complementary colour of blue. The settings I chose to get to this scheme
include the <strong>Contrast</strong> setting at lower
left,
the <strong>default</strong> on the menu below the
generator, and <strong>normal vision</strong>. Notice that
the main
colour
selected is marked by a black dot on the inner disc of the colour wheel
(both above and online at the generator site) and that the opposite,
complementary colour that was automatically picked for you is marked
with a hollow circle in the inner rim. These markings make it
easier for you to analyze your colour scheme.</p>

<p>This colour generator makes it easy for you to choose colours
for
links, visited links, and even images as it provides the hex colours for
you at the upper right. You can mix and match any pure colour (the colour
at the top) and its tint, tone or shade and feel great about choosing a
solid colour scheme.</p>

<p><img style="width: 390px; height: 271px;" alt="Greenpeace" src="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/358/greenpeace.jpg" /></p>
<p class="comment">Figure 7: The Greenpeace site—a good
example of a complementary colour scheme.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/">Greenpeace
USA</a> (see Figure 7) is one
of many sites that uses a contrasting colour scheme. Yes, you see
yellows and oranges, but the predominant colours are green and red—two
colours that are directly opposite each other on the colour wheel. You
almost can’t go wrong with this complementary colour method. In fact,
the
use of a “warm” and “cool” colour combination makes a site zing with
colour contrast.</p>

<h3 id="warmcool">Warm vs. cool colours</h3>

<p>Complementary colour schemes are great to use in web sites, as
they also
contain both warm and cool colours. The use of these colours provides
contrast, and it’s easy to remember which colours are &quot;warm&quot; and which
colours are &quot;cool&quot; as you can see in Figure 8 (and on the colour
generator site):</p>

<p><img style="width: 390px; height: 384px;" alt="Warm and cool colours" src="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/358/7.warm_cool.jpg" /></p>
<p class="comment">Figure 8: Warm and cool colours.</p>

<p>Warm colours are those colours that would remind you of the
summer, sun
or fire. They consist of violets to yellows. Cool colours might remind
you of spring, ice, or water. Those colours range from yellow-green back
to violet. If you notice how the colours work on the wheel, you’ll soon
discover that you can’t choose one colour without choosing its opposite
in &quot;temperature.&quot; So, if you pick a hot red, the opposite is a cool
green. Or, if you pick a cool blue-green, you’ll end up with a spicy
red-orange on the other side.</p>

<p>One example of a site that consistently uses a warm/cool colour
combination is <a href="http://www.ecolution.com/">Ecolution</a>,
as seen in Figure 9.</p>

<p><img style="width: 390px; height: 339px;" alt="Ecolution" src="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/358/8.warm_cool_site.jpg" /></p>
<p class="comment">Figure 9: Ecolution—a good example of
warm/cool colours.</p>

<p>Ecolution usually uses red as an accent colour on their home
page in
contrast to their green logo. They then blend the two contrasting
colours with varying tints, tones and shades of those two colours. Even
the “blacks” in an image can lean toward “warm” or “cool,” as do
whites. Overall, the photograph is “warm,” which plays nicely with the
stark pure green. Although they use the same colours as Greenpeace, the
Ecolution site takes on less “glare” with the rich tones and shades in
the photograph.</p>

<p>You never realized that colour theory was so easy, did you?
Well, then…let’s complicate the issue a bit…</p>

<h3 id="triadic">Triadic colour schemes</h3>

<p>A triadic colour scheme (see Figure 10) is created when you pick one
colour and then
pick two other colours that lie equidistant from each other around the
circle, like so:</p>

<p><img style="width: 390px; height: 247px;" alt="Triadic colour scheme" src="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/358/8.triadic.jpg" /></p>
<p class="comment">Figure 10: A triadic colour scheme.</p>

<p>I chose the primary colours for this scheme as I wanted to show
how the
colour schemes seem to contain a method to the madness. It’s no accident
that the primary colours lie where they do on the colour wheel, as each
colour contains an equal amount of secondary and tertiary colours between
each primary. But, a primary colour triadic scheme can seem old-hat as
it has been overused. Instead, you might try some other colour choices
at the online colour generator, something like Figure 11:</p>

<p><img style="width: 390px; height: 237px;" alt="Online triadic colour scheme" src="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/358/9.triadic_2.jpg" /></p>
<p class="comment">Figure 11: An alternative triadic colour
scheme.</p>

<p>The above triad scheme is built from orange-yellow,
blue-green, and
red-violet. I picked the orange-yellow first (notice the dark dot on
the inner section of the colour wheel at left), and then chose the <strong>Triad</strong>
selection located beneath the wheel. The generator automatically chose
the triadic choices including all tints, tones and shades. The
accompanying colours are marked on the colour wheel with the hollow dots,
just as the complementary colour was noted in the monochromatic example.</p>

<p>Now, this is where a real colour wheel might come in handy, as
the
online results didn’t quite match the results of a hand-held colour
wheel. When I pushed the <strong>Angle/Distance</strong>
tool under the colour wheel to &quot;max,&quot; however, it seemed to match the
colour wheel I held in my hand. The results shown above are those that
matched the colour wheel the closest.</p>

<p>The triadic colour scheme also contains warm and cool colours,
but one
temperature will predominate. Usually, the temperature that will
overshadow the other is the one that you chose on the front end. In
this case, I initially chose the orange-yellow, which is a warm colour.
The warm colours shown above will predominate as a result, with one of
the other two colours lending the cool contrast.</p>

<p><img style="width: 390px; height: 340px;" alt="Puzzle Pirates" src="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/358/10.triadic_site.jpg" /></p>
<p class="comment">Figure 12: Puzzle Pirates—A good
triadic colour scheme.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.puzzlepirates.com/">Puzzle
Pirates</a>, shown
in Figure 12, uses a triadic scheme on their home page. They use the
primary red-blue-yellow scheme, and this primary scheme is perfect for
a kid’s game site. Note that the blue is predominant and that the reds
and yellows are used as accents and to lead the eye around the page.
</p>

<h3 id="tetradic">Tetradic colour schemes</h3>

<p>The more colours you choose, the more complicated the colour
scheme.
However, one trick is to find a tint, tone or shade and stick to
those regions across the board rather than mix pure colours and their
tints, tones and shades. This method works well with a colour scheme
such as the four-colour tetradic scheme. This scheme (see Figure 13) is
just like the complementary scheme, only you use two complementaries
that are
equidistant.</p>

<p><img style="width: 390px; height: 99px;" alt="Tetradic colour scheme" src="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/358/11.tetrad.jpg" /></p>
<p class="comment">Figure 13: Tetradic colour schemes.</p>

<p>Figure 14 shows how a tetrad scheme works out online:</p>

<p><img style="width: 390px; height: 242px;" alt="Online tetrad example" src="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/358/12.tetrad_online.jpg" /></p>
<p class="comment">Figure 14: A tetradic colour scheme
inside the online generator.</p>

<p>Note the black dot under the red in the colour wheel to the
left. This was the first colour that I chose; I then clicked on the <strong>Tetrad</strong>
button beneath the wheel. The four colours that showed up once again
were a bit off from my hand-held colour wheel, but when I pushed the <strong>Angle/Distance</strong>
tool under the colour wheel to &quot;max,&quot; it seemed to match the colour wheel
I held in my hand. The results shown above are those that matched the
colour wheel the closest.</p>

<p>This colour scheme can become quite complicated, so what you
might
want to do at this point is to pick all four tints or tones or shades
from the colours in the right column. You can make your choices by
clicking the arrows at the far right. For instance, Figure 15 shows an
example
of a block filled with the tints of this colour scheme:</p>

<p class="comment">Figure 15: Tetradic tints.</p>

<p>And Figure 16 shows an example of the mid-range tones:</p>

<p><img style="width: 390px; height: 283px;" alt="Triadic midrange" src="../../../../devfiles.myopera.com/articles/358/14.midrange.jpg" /></p>
<p class="comment">Figure 16: Tetradic mid-range tones.</p>

<p>If you look closely at the squares above, you’ll see that the
generator
also provides you with four monochromatic colour schemes. These schemes
are shown both in the column to the right as well as in each square
within the larger square.</p>

<p class="comment">Figure 17: The Jane Goodall Institute
site—a good tetradic colour scheme example.</p>

<p>The Jane Goodall Institute site (Figure 17) is one of the few
sites that really
carries the tetradic colour scheme well. Note the purple, the yellow
tone, the red highlights in the photograph (the site holds more red
further down on the page), and the greens. The purple doesn’t match up
exactly to the colour scheme generated by the online colour tool—it
leans toward a red-violet—but it’s close enough to use as an example
of how you can use both a colour wheel and the online colour generator
to produce ideas for your site.</p>

<p>Now, when you surf around the Web searching for colour and
design ideas,
keep your colour wheel close at hand to learn more about how designers
use colour schemes on your favorite Web sites!</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Although colour combinations may seem complicated, all colour
schemes
carry certain &quot;rules.&quot; These guidelines make it easy to understand
which colours work together to add interest and contrast to a Web site.</p>

<p>The reason colour wheels exist are for people to use them.
Colour
wheels and tools like the online Color Generator make colour-picking
easy even for the inexperienced designer.</p>

<p>The four colour schemes covered in this article are monochromatic, complementary, triadic, and tetradic. Although other colour schemes exist, these four colour schemes are the easiest to understand and implement.</p>


<h2 id="exercises">Exercise Questions</h2>

<p>Note: the last two questions do not have &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;
answers.</p>

<ul>

  <li>Name the three primary colours, and explain why they’re
called primary colours.</li>

  <li>Name the three secondary colours and the primary colours that
are used to make those secondary hues.</li>

  <li>Describe how a tint, a tone, and a shade are made.</li>

  <li>What is a triadic colour scheme? Can you pick three colours
that would fit this scheme?</li>

  <li>What is a tetradic colour scheme? Can you pick four colours
that would fit this scheme?</li>
