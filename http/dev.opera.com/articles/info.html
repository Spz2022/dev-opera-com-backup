  <h2>Help us make Dev.Opera a great developer community</h2>
  
  <ul class="nobullets faq">
    <li>
      <h3>How can I contribute an article?</h3>
      <p>
        If you want to submit an article to us for publication, enter it
        into our <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/create">article submission form</a>. If you have any questions
        about the site or any aspects of writing an article and the publishing
        process, e-mail our friendly site editor at <em>andreasb [at] opera [dot] com</em>. He
        doesn't bite.
      </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <h3>Do you pay for articles?</h3>
      <p>YES! We pay a rate of US$350 for a 2000 word article, so
        ideally you should try to stick to around that word count.
        Multiple part articles will be considered.</p>
      <p>Please note that this doesn't include translations of
        existing articles: these are currently done by several very
        generous people on a volunteer basis, and for that we are
        eternally grateful.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <h3>What kind of topics do we publish?</h3>
      <p>
        The goal of Dev.Opera is to provide a central repository for
        topics existing in and around the area of web standards, including
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other technologies, but also including
        accessibility, usability, social networking, <acronym title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</acronym> and other
        such topics. Basically, our mandate is "anything that could be
        useful to a client-side developer or designer," which certainly
        doesn't preclude content about server-side topics or proprietary
        formats such as Flash, as long as it is framed in the context of
        making them play better with standards.
      </p>
      <p>As well as currently web standards, we are also very
        interested in publishing future-facing articles about using
        nascent standards such as HTML 5, CSS 3, etc.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <h3>What aren't we looking for?</h3>
      <p>
        Ideally we are looking for practical articles, covering
        techniques and tips that can be immediately useful to a
        developer, or provoke inspired thought. We aren't looking to
        publish pure rants, opinion pieces, or marketing pieces.
        Material on hard-core server-side techniques is also out of
        scope (eg Java programming, database optimization). In addition,
        we don't advocate proprietary technologies at Opera, so we won't
        publish articles <em>purely</em> focused on Flash, or covering
        other plugins such as Silverlight and JavaFX.
      </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <h3>What level articles do we publish?</h3>
      <p>
        Most of the articles on Dev.Opera are intermediate or advanced,
        aimed at providing web designers and developers with interesting
        techniques to expand their toolbox. We do however have a comprehensive
        beginner's course, the <a href="view/1-introduction-to-the-web-standards-cur/index.html">Opera Web Standards Curriculum</a>. If you
        have an idea for a beginner's article that isn't already covered and
        you feel would be a good addition, run the idea past the site editor.
      </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <h3>What format should I submit my article in?</h3>
      <p>The actual text of the article itself should be submitted
        in semantic HTML. Please validate your HTML before submitting it
        to us; really bad markup specimens may not be accepted. In terms
        of images, any web-suitable image format is fine, although we
        prefer PNGs.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <h3>When will you publish my article?</h3>
      <p>All articles must be reviewed by the Dev.Opera editor to
        ensure a high level of quality. He will edit it, make comments,
        and return it to you for a round of rewrites (or more if
        necessary). Once you and the editor have agreed on the content,
        it should be published about a week or two after that. We always
        aim to have articles reviewed as quickly as possible, but we
        appreciate your patience.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <h3>What about licenses and copyright?</h3>
      <p>There are currently 2 Creative Commons licensing options
        for publishing your articles. During submission, let our editor
        know which license suits you best. The choices are:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><b><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported</a></b></li>
        <li><b><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</a></b></li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>We make every attempt to ensure copyrights are respected.
        As such, you may only submit articles that you have written and
        have ownership of.</p>
    </li>
